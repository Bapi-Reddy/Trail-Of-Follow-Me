# Follow-Me
A real-time object tracking application using [Google's TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/object_detection) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/).

## Getting Started
1. `python object_detection_app.py`
    Optional arguments (default value):
    * Device index of the camera `--source=0`
    * Width of the frames in the video stream `--width=480`
    * Height of the frames in the video stream `--height=360`
    * Number of workers `--num-workers=2`
    * Size of the queue `--queue-size=5`

## Requirements
- [TensorFlow 1.2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [OpenCV 3.0](http://opencv.org/)

## Notes
- OpenCV 3.1 might crash on OSX after a while, so that's why I had to switch to version 3.0. See open issue and solution [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/5874).
- Moving the `.read()` part of the video stream in a multiple child processes did not work. However, it was possible to move it to a separate thread.
